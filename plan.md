# Superhuman Balatro AI Rebuild Plan

## Objective

Build an agent that exceeds a declared strong-human benchmark on clean Balatro runs while using only information available through the normal game interface. Fast-environment results, source-rule inventories, and isolated parity checks are supporting diagnostics, never success criteria.

## Execution Status (2026-08-07)

The failed independent simulator, planner, imitation pipeline, rule-presence gate, and their scripts/tests have been removed. The first foundation is implemented: typed public observations and actions, an adversarial information firewall, a strict BalatroBot observed-state backend, stable canonical state, provenance-rich tamper-evident traces, and no-waiver differential replay. The replacement test suite passes. Across 68 retained real-trace files, the canonicalizer accepts all 20,542 snapshots; the firewall accepts all 20,532 settled decisions and rejects only 10 transient `HAND_PLAYED`/`DRAW_TO_HAND` states.

A fresh public-action Red/White seed-1 smoke run completed in real Balatro and its five decisions reproduced exactly in a second real run. Jackdaw is pinned at `dbedc66255fe594cce7b7cccc188c8a11649d9ec`; its upstream suite passes 1,561 tests. Its raw bridge initially had 638 representational differences from BalatroBot. A narrow adapter now derives BalatroBot's representation from Jackdaw's own state, and all five smoke transitions match exactly. Jackdaw remains untrusted beyond that tiny losing trace. This is not yet a trained agent: OS-process isolation for the policy, broad randomized candidate lockstep, complete consumable legality, and the real-game snapshot extension remain open. No learned model should be built until those gates pass.

### Active Increment: Deterministic Differential Campaign

- Add a deterministic coverage policy driven only by `PublicObservation`, public history, and an explicit policy seed.
- Keep action selection bounded and family-aware; never enumerate the factorial reorder tail or enable actions whose public legality is incomplete.
- Record one exclusive authority trace per game, replay it immediately through pinned Jackdaw, and stop at the first exact mismatch.
- Begin with a small Red/White development panel. A terminal loss is acceptable coverage evidence but never policy-strength evidence.
- Promote neither the candidate nor policy work until the panel is complete and mismatch-free; every divergence becomes a candidate/adapter regression test.
- Current status: the first exclusive development trace at `runs/differential-dev/coverage-v1-seed1-rerun/red-white-seed1.jsonl` now replays cleanly through pinned Jackdaw with 23/23 checked transitions after fixing round-target timing, first-shop Buffoon RNG, BalatroBot-shaped ability projection, null optional value fields, and source-backed rarity projection. Trace-derived coverage accounting now reads the actual public state sequence, records legal opportunities and accepted families, and passes the explicit skip-pack lane. Next, run separate pick and mixed lanes across new seeds; stop and regress the first divergence.

## Design

Use a two-kernel architecture. Actual Balatro under a pinned BalatroBot/LÖVE build is the authority. A pinned, independently audited Jackdaw fork is the candidate high-throughput training/search kernel. Expose the same typed state/action contract from both and continuously compare organic trajectories. In parallel, prototype in-memory snapshot/restore and batch rollouts inside real Balatro; use the real kernel directly wherever its measured throughput permits.

Keep privileged state behind a process boundary. The deployed policy and online search receive only `PublicObservation` plus public action/observation history. They never receive the run seed, shuffled deck order, future RNG, private object identifiers, or a clone of the live hidden state. Fair search creates belief particles consistent with public history and samples unknown events from the correct conditional distribution.

The system has five layers:

1. Public/private contract: an observation firewall, typed visible action candidates, public history, private canonical state, and adversarial hidden-state-twin tests.
2. Dual environment: real Balatro authority plus a differentially certified fast candidate, both exposing reset, action, settle, observation, terminal outcome, and event trace.
3. Search: belief-state planning over hidden information, exhaustive tactical action generation where affordable, and sampled strategic rollouts for shops, packs, skips, and consumables.
4. Learning: policy and distributional value networks trained by expert iteration from belief-averaged search targets, with item/card/joker instances represented compositionally rather than by one flat linear ranker.
5. Evaluation: frozen agents, evaluator-secret seeds generated after freeze, immutable traces, confidence intervals, and direct comparison with human and program baselines across decks and stakes.

## Acceptance Standard

- No debug mutation endpoints and no injected state.
- Policy input and search contain no seed, hidden deck order, future shop contents, actual RNG state, or hidden-state-dependent legal-action leak.
- Every reported agent is identified by code revision, configuration, model digest, game/mod versions, and seed manifest.
- Promotion metrics come only from authoritative-engine or clean live runs of that exact frozen artifact.
- The final superhuman claim requires a predeclared benchmark over all 15 standard decks at Gold stake, evaluator-secret seeds, enough games for simultaneous confidence bounds, and performance exceeding a preregistered elite-human reference under the same rules and information.

## Build Order

### 1. Prove the information boundary and environments

- Implement explicit `PublicObservation`, `PrivateState`, `PublicActionCandidate`, and public-history types before policy work.
- Add public-twins tests: changing only inaccessible hidden state must not change policy input, visible legal candidates, or the action distribution.
- Pin and audit Jackdaw instead of building another independent simulator from scratch.
- Prototype BalatroBot in-memory snapshots and batched real-game rollouts using the game's own save representation; verify snapshot/RNG fidelity before using it for search.
- Build an organic differential corpus from real public-action traces and require exact next-state agreement for the complete canonical semantic state, not a hand-selected projection.
- Make unsupported actions or state fields fail closed. There are no waivers in acceptance traces.

Exit criterion: randomized action-sequence differential tests pass on a broad source-derived state/action coverage matrix, including stochastic branches and persistent card/joker state; the observation firewall passes adversarial leakage tests; throughput is measured under the intended belief-search workload.

### 2. Establish honest baselines

- Random legal agent.
- Greedy immediate-score tactical agent.
- Handcrafted search baseline with no learned value.
- Human-reference benchmark collected under the same observation and seed rules.

Exit criterion: every baseline is reproducible from a frozen artifact and evaluated on separate development and test seed manifests.

### 3. Build search before learning

- Enumerate or beam-search tactical play/discard actions with the authoritative kernel.
- Use root-sampled POMCP, stochastic MCTS, or sampled expectimax for hidden shops, packs, tags, and draws.
- Share determinizations across sibling actions to avoid optimism bias.
- Recondition the particle belief after every public observation; never clone or inspect the actual live hidden state for a deployed decision.
- Search complete run actions, including selling, ordering, targeting, rerolling, skipping, and multi-pick packs.

Exit criterion: search materially beats the handcrafted baseline on held-out authoritative runs and transfers unchanged to clean live execution.

### 4. Add learned policy and value models

- Encode card and joker instances, consumables, vouchers, blinds, tags, and typed action candidates with embeddings, modifiers, counters, order, targets, and set/graph structure. Include Gold-stake mechanics in the schema from the start.
- Train a policy prior from belief-averaged search visit counts and a calibrated distributional survival/win head from authoritative outcomes.
- Use expert iteration/self-generated play; retain hard states from live and authoritative evaluations for regression and targeted replay.
- Calibrate the value model by ante, stake, deck, and build archetype before allowing it to prune search aggressively.

Exit criterion: the learned-search agent beats search alone on a locked held-out suite without increasing live/authoritative disagreement.

### 5. Curriculum and final evaluation

- Red/White is an engineering smoke test, then train across decks and stakes; do not treat White success as strategic promotion evidence.
- Increase each stake's training weight only after its authoritative coverage exists; Gold-stake mechanics remain present in the observation and model schema from the start.
- Lock architecture and hyperparameters before the final Gold-stake benchmark.
- Generate the sealed final seed manifest only after the artifact is frozen, run one attempt per condition, and publish all traces, failures, model metadata, compute limits, and confidence intervals.

Exit criterion: the frozen agent clears the predeclared superhuman benchmark across all decks at Gold stake.

## Kill Criteria

- Stop policy work if authoritative and live outcomes diverge for any agent-relevant transition.
- Stop if changing only private state changes a deployed decision.
- Stop if search receives the live seed, hidden deck order, actual future RNG, or a private clone.
- Stop training if improvements appear only in a surrogate environment.
- Reject a milestone if the evaluated policy changed during the seed sweep.
- Reject parity or coverage metrics based only on identifier presence, shape checks, tolerated mismatches, or waived behavior.
- Replace the environment approach if it cannot clone/step fast enough for useful search without changing game semantics.

## First Milestone

The first half is complete: one Red/White seed ran to terminal loss through a frozen public-observation smoke policy, and all five decisions reproduced in a fresh authoritative run with exact observed-state agreement and no waivers. Regenerate this evidence after any source change. The remaining milestone is randomized public-action replay across a fixed coverage matrix before implementing a learned model.
